# [Competitive Coding (MUST READ!!!)]
 
 This repository is solely dedicated for the collection of codes of **practice problems/classsical problems (only)** of populare coding sites such at spoj, topcoder, hackerearth, codechef, etc.

 *Format of Naming of Codes must be as follows:-*
 > each problem can be uniquely identified.For Example the classical problems of SPOJ have an ID number.
   so the code must be name as:

   >prog1.c or prog1.cpp or whatever language you are using.
    **The first line in the code must be a comment to the link of the question.** 
    ***IF the problem cannot be Uniquely Identified then use full name as given in the question but the first line as comment in the link is compulsory.*** 

  each code can be asked for multiple pull requests as long as the programming language keeps changing i.e. a code written in Java can be converted to Python and a pull request can be asked for.
