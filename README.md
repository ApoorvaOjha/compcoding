# [Competitive Coding (MUST READ!!!)]()
 
 This repository is solely dedicated for the collection of codes of **practice problems/classsical problems (only) that may not affect a users ranking** of popular coding sites such at spoj, topcoder, hackerearth, codechef, etc.

 *Also* ***DO NOT*** *provide your code if you hold some kind of record like best submission,etc. on that piece of code.*

 *Format of Naming of Codes must be as follows:-*

 > Each problem must be uniquely identified.
  
  For Example the classical problems of SPOJ have an ID number.

   so the code must be name as:
 >> prog[ID].extension i.e. prog1.c or prog1.cpp or whatever language you are using.

 >>**The first line in the code must be a comment to the link of the question.**

 >> ***IF the problem cannot be Uniquely Identified then use full name as given in the question but the first line as comment in the code must being link to the problem is compulsory.*** 

  each code can be asked for multiple pull requests as long as the programming language keeps changing i.e. a code written in Java can be converted to Python and a pull request can be asked for.
